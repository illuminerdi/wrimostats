* http://github.com/illuminerdi/wrimostats/tree/master
* http://www.nanowrimo.org

== DESCRIPTION:

This Rails application will allow a user to create an account, associate it with a Nanowrimo User ID, and customize their own stats dashboard, create wordwars, and generate charts and graphs on the fly.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Features:
* None yet, but uses the illuminerdi-nanowrimo gem to easily pull data out of the Nanowrimo WCAPI
* Create a user account that allows you to customize your WC statistics, or those for your Region, Genre, or the entire Nanowrimo program.
* Generate dynamic and on-the-fly flash-based graphs using the FusionCharts package.
* Create a word war, where your running stats and those of chosen 'writing buddies' are compared in charts and graphs. Will have a higher upper-bound for number of buddies than the Nanowrimo site official widgets allow.

Problems:
* Well, it needs to be created.
* Man, it might be nice if there's a FusionCharts Ruby gem already with Rails hooks. I'd probably have to make one. Dammit.

== SYNOPSIS:

It's a rails app. Hopefully there will be nothing special required to get it running. It should run on some awesome host with Passenger support - I'll figure that out when November gets closer.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ruby 1.8.6
* rails 2.3.2
* illuminerdi-nanowrimo 0.6

== INSTALL:

clone this repo, then be railsy:
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ ruby script/server
